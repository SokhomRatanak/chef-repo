In the software engineering, testing is an important part of the work ensuring optimal quality of a program and meeting the requirement of the client at the same time. As a result, we want these tests to be included as early as possible in the tool chain and as automatic as possible to cut down risks and costs. Testing can be understand as *Unit Testing* where a small portion of the code is evaluated and tested. Additionally, testing ca be seen as *Functional Testing* making sure the software meets the User expectation from a usability perspective. This guide covers the installation of such a tool chain targeting PHP_ programming language in the frame of TYPO3_.
