Behat was inspired by Ruby's Cucumber project and especially its syntax part (Gherkin). Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software’s behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented. Gherkin serves two purposes – documentation and automated tests.
